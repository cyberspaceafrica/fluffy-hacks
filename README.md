# Gruyere

Gruyere is an excellent choice for beginners who want to learn how to locate and exploit vulnerabilities and how to fight against them. It also uses “cheesy” coding, and the entire design is based on cheese. To make things easier, it’s written in Python and categorized by vulnerability kinds.
A brief description of the vulnerability that you’ll locate, exploit, and identify using black-box or white-box hacking (or a combination of both techniques) for each task. Some of them are :

    Information disclosure
    SQL injection
    Cross-site request forgery
    Denial-of-service attacks
